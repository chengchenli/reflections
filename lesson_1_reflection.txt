What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    pro: more meaningful saves
    con: easy to forget to save

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    if a set of files need to be executed together then they should be saved in 
    one commit. If each file is individually used from another, then we do not
    need this function

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    To see the commit comments we have saved, and to use git diff to compare the
    changes between two commits.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    I know I can always go back to a previously workig version.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    doing projects for machine learning course
